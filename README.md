# BigData

MovieLens PySpark project. This project was assigned to the students (including me) by The Hague University. The students had to find a way to recommend 10 movies per user to 50.000 users which they have not seen yet and will most likely want to watch one of those 10 movies. The movies that were recommended to users were movies that were most often rated and that had a rating higher than 4.0. To test our outocome, the school provided us with a test dataset which we had to use.
I could unfortunately not include the data which I used for the project, because they were too heavy for a GitHub push (800mb+ total).

I wanted to try to make the recommendation more precise in <b>Pyspark_Eindproject_extended</b>, but didn't have the time anymore due to deadlines.
